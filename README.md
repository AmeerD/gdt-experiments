# gdt-experiments
Code to reproduce all figures from Dharamshi, Neufeld, Motwani, Gao, Witten, and Bien (2024), which will appear in JASA.

The script in the "Numerical experiments" folder generates Figure S1 ("numerical_example_figure.pdf").

The script in the "Changepoint detection" folder produces Figures 2 ("simulation_T1E.pdf"), 3 ("application.pdf""), S2 ("simulation_null.pdf"), and S3 ("simulation_alt.pdf").
